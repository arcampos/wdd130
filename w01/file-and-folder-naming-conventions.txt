Overview

When working on the web, there are many things that affect the operation of the files
--the browser, the protocol(s), the operating system, the lenguage(s), etc. While many
of these are out of your control, there are steps you can take to help keep things consistent
and maneageable through standard file and folder naming conventions.

"when you're building a website, you need to assemble these files into a sensible
structure on your locl computer, make sure they can talk to one another, and get all your
content looking right before you eventually upload them to a server." -MDN 

Prepare
* the file and folder naming conventions will be considered 'best-practice' rules for this
course, These rules should be applied to all files and folders created in you course work.

    Note that most organizations have defined a standard convention for naming files and
    folders in addition to other workflows. These conventions may vary as each organization
    will have their own file management guidelines and 'best' practices.

Naming conventions rules
* Use all lowercase syntax.
    Platforms and systems handle case sensitivity differently. Case sensitivity is an important concept to 
    understand when managing files and folders.
    Example: products.html 

* Do NOT use spaces in names. Use dashes instead
    Spaces are interpreted obtusely by user agents, therefore, do not use them. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
    (HTTP) ignores spaces, except in file names, it replaces a space with a simbol -"%20." This makes URL's look 
    confusing and can also lend itself to confusion in the mind of site visitors. So avoid using spaces. Instead, if 
    you have to create a visual space, use hyphens/dashes.
    Example: desing-document.html

* Do NOT use special characters
    Special characters often mean specific things to computers, so just avoid using them completely in the 
    naming of files and folders.
    Special characters examples (avoid these): <,>, \, /, #, ?, ! 

* Use as short and as meaningful (semantic) of names as possible
    Short, meaningful names save you, other developers, and site visitors from having to remember
    long complicated names for files and folders. When meaningful, they also help predict the purpose
    of nature of the file or folder contents when working with those files and folders.
    Example: winter-scene-sm.png VS  image13-v123523brokenbranchlifeimagery w200x200.png

* In this class, the standard folder names for our sites/sub-folders are:
    - styles = folders with this name contain our CSS files.
    - images = folders with this name contain our images.

Whenever an image does not show up, first check the file name and then the file path. Sites use
relative paths for local resources. A relative path does not start with an internet protocol.

relative path example:
<img src="images/myImage.png">

Absolute references use external resources and start with a protocol.

Absolute path example:
<img src="http://resource.thesite.com/images/breakfast.svg">
